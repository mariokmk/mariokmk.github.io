I've been planning on getting my blog running for a while. I didn't want to deal with hosting it myself so my options were the usual suspects like WordPress and Blogger. Those are intersting platforms with their own strenghts but I wanted something lighter, easy to edit and which would maintain history.

I finally found a [great post](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) with simple instructions on hosting it on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole). Got the site up and running in no time.

Now off to configure settings and discussions.
